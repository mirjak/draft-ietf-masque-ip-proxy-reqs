However, during negotiation the new protocol will need the ability to negotiate addresses, similar to DHCP. The most common use case will most likely be one where the client connects and the proxy assigns it one address (along with configuring gateway, routes, DNS, etc.). However, I believe that we should support the use case where the client tells the server \"I own this subnet\", since QBONE uses that in production today.",

          "body": "@DavidSchinazi I think we should dig more into what the implications are of proxying a subnet compared to an address that comes from a range provided by the MASQUE server. I think these differences are significant and have impact on what is required for safe general deployment of the protocol. \r\n\r\nSo if one proxying a single IP address borrowed from the MASQUE server then;\r\n - Source Address validation is trivial, the MASQUE client's traffic will leave the MASQUE server with an address belonging to the MASQUE server so no risk of source address spoofing.\r\n - There are no routing considerations for the MASQUE server as the address use by the MASQUE server is not routed by the MASQUE server. \r\n\r\nFor a sub-net proxying the above concerns looks significantly different.\r\n - The MASQUE server does not own the IP subnet range and thus needs additional mechanism to determine if the MASQUE client is an actual gateway for that subnet or is simply spoofing that subnet.\r\n - The MASQUE server need to inject routes for the subnet upstream of it self to ensure that there are a return routability path. Such operations have significant operational concerns. \r\n\r\nThus, the security considerations and necessary security model for these operational concerns are very different from proxying individual IP address belonging to the MASQUE server. That is why I am arguing that this needs to be an extension in a separate document. \r\n\r\nI understand that in QBONE you have this functionality. But, this is a specific use case and deployment where you have considered how you in this specific model handle these cases. Thus the scope and the description necessary are different from single IP address proxying. For a standardized mechanism I hope you agree that these concerns needs to be raised and addressed through either limitations in applicability scope and/or solutions to the security threats of using the mechanism. \r\n\r\nThus can we put the subnet functionality as an extension where these additional scope and security aspects can be handled differently rather than trying to have them both in the same document. I also expect differences in progress due to the review and feedback necessary to bring the subnet parts to IETF consensus. ",

I think the question of flow control is a question of what mode the client want the QUIC tunnel to operate in depending on the path characteristics. In most cases I would assume an unreliable tunneling is sufficient, however over lossy links using QUIC as a reliability mechanism may be desired. I think one use case for this purpose that has been discussed in some circuits are for local repair between an endpoint in a local WIFI network, where the local network is connected to Internet over an satellite link. Local WIFI loses one like to retransmit over that local network, not end-to-end over a satellite path. In such a scenario one would need flow control as the retransmission buffering is not unlimited. So a question to the WG is if we actually need a control surface for which style of operation one are using?\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Even the first one can result in need for a reordering buffer in the server to ensure that traffic is forwarded without reordering.\r\n\r\nDoes this also need some additional concerns if someone deploys the servers under different networks, resulting in multi-homing scenarios where outgoing and returning traffic for sub-flows ends up in different paths?

This implies no rewrite of any of the inner headers by the MASQUE client or server. I think the network to network use cases are aiming for pure tunneling as the source IP address of packet the MASQUE server decapsulate will not be rewritten. \r\n\r\nIP Proxying could be to encapsualte the complete header but have the MASQUE server rewrite the source IP address after decapsulation and then forward it towards the target address. Due to this I think the single client to network use case can be proxying. \r\n\r\nIf we contrast this with the UDP proxying (CONNECT-UDP) where an inner UDP payload destined to the target from the MASQUE client gets it IP + UDP headers generated by the MASQUE Server (proxy) before the packet being forward towards target. \r\n\r\nSo I hope you see that there might be some mismatch in expectations between parties here.

This seems too restrictive for a requirement, as it wouldn't even allow any kind of preconfigured compression. I'm not even sure if we need a requirement to have an option to forward unmodified. There I actually propose to just remove it for now.\r\n\r\nAlso as a side note, I find the term Data Transport not ideal. How about Forwarding Association? That term is a bit clumsy but would be clear at least for me. I guess it would be good to agree to a common terminology here.",

That doesn't mean that it has to appear unmodified inside QUIC. For instance, one might do header compression inside the channel. It seems like one might have extensions (e.g., NAT or v4/v6 translation) but those affect the exterior interfaces, not the channel.",
